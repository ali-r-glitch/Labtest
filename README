Errors and fixes
There were two errors originally in the code. Firstly the student number was not displayed. This was fixed by simply 
tracking the student number. Adding a variable that had the name and would set it as a pair with the highest mark.
The second issue was there was a mixup of the mark and the student number being displayed.This was fixed by altering 
how the columns are defined/set as. The index was altered to set them as seperate columns by adding an increment to 
the loop. 

Code functionality
This code searches through a textfile that has headings "Marks" and "Student Number". It will then find the highest
mark and output the student number and mark.

Technical
It gets the seperates columns based on the name "Marks" and "Student Number". It then compares the values of the marks
and finds the highest value.
